# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support and maintain only the latest version of the codebase, as found on the `main` branch. All security updates and patches will be applied exclusively to this version. Older versions are not monitored or updated and should be used at your own risk.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously and value the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please report it through the **Security** tab on our repository. To help us respond quickly and effectively, include as much detail as possible, such as:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigations

Please do **not** create public issues or pull requests for security concerns, as this may put users at risk.

We will investigate and respond to all valid reports promptly and, if appropriate, will publicly disclose the issue once a fix is available.
