Haha, got it—let’s dial it back to something more neutral and professional, but still chill and appropriate for a solo hobby project. Here’s a more “normal” version of the **Contributing Guidelines**:

# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in this project! It's currently a personal side project maintained by a solo developer, so things may be a bit informal, but contributions are still very welcome.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Check Existing Issues
Before starting work, check the [Issues](../../issues) tab to see if there’s already a discussion or report related to your idea or bug. If not, feel free to open a new issue.

### 2. Submitting Changes
If you’d like to contribute code:
- Fork the repository
- Create a new branch for your change
- Keep the changes focused and relevant
- Open a pull request to the `main` branch with a clear description of what you’ve done

Even small fixes are appreciated.

### 3. Code Style
There’s no strict style guide, but try to match the existing code in terms of formatting and structure. Clean, readable code with comments where needed is ideal.

## Communication

If you’re not sure about something or want to propose a feature, open an issue first. It helps avoid duplicate work and makes sure we're on the same page.

## Final Notes

- Since this is a hobby project, responses may take some time.
- Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

Thanks for contributing!
